#### Tabs consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of buttons with a **Company Name** which on click shows the work experience in that particular company.
- Each single experience card has an **title**,**dates**, **company**, **duties** along with a button **More Info**.
- **` Loading...`** has been implemented which will be shown while fetching data, once the data is available the main page will be shown. 
- Data is handled by the external `API` and styles are handled in `index.css`.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
